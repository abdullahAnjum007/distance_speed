# Project Title
# Distance and Speed Tracker - React Native Expo App

Welcome to the Distance and Speed Tracker app! This app is built with React Native and Expo, and uses `geolib` for distance calculations and `expo-location` for getting the device's current location. It features a map view to display the current location and provides real-time distance and speed tracking while traveling.

## Features
- Tracks distance traveled using geolocation.
- Displays real-time speed based on location updates.
- Interactive map view with markers to visualize your journey.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and Expo CLI installed. If you don't have these, follow the installation guides below:

1. Install Node.js: [Download and Install](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`

Once you have Node.js and Expo CLI installed, follow these steps to run the app:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

5. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or on your browser to view the app.

## Usage
The app displays a map with your current location. As you move, it calculates the distance traveled and estimates your speed. Here's how to use it:

1. Launch the app via Expo.
2. Allow location permissions when prompted.
3. Start moving to track your distance and speed.

## Important Libraries
- `geolib`: Provides geospatial functions for calculating distances.
- `expo-location`: Allows access to the device's location services.
- `react-native-maps`: Used for displaying maps and markers.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, try the following:

- Ensure location services are enabled on your device.
- Restart the Expo server and re-run the app.
- Check for error messages in the terminal or Expo logs.
